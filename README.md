# GMFL_Improved

An improved tool for the CyberPatriot competition.

# Reminders:

1. It is against CyberPatriot rules to use someone elses scripts. You can mess around with these in your own VMs, and take inspiration from them, but you can't use them in competition.
2. All of these scripts are written in bash, which for Linux. These scripts will only work on Linux.
3. If you find a bug, or want to ask me anything about these scripts, you can contact me at hockeyplayerlogan@gmail.com.
