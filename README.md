# GMFL_Improved

An improved tool for the CyberPatriot competition.

# Before You Begin:

1. It is against CyberPatriot rules to use someone elses scripts. You can mess around with these in your own VMs, and take inspiration from them, but you can't use them in competition.
2. All of these scripts are written in bash, which for Linux. These scripts will only work on Linux.
3. If you find a bug, or want to ask me anything about these scripts, you can contact me on my GitHub account, https://github.com/hufflegamer123/.

# How to Use:

You should read the readme.md file for each script before using it. Many of the scripts have files that require your user input. Eventually, I will stop being lazy, and add a -h option to cat the readme into the console. Until then, just navigate into the GMFL_Improved/readmes/ directory.
