# individual_scripts/delUsers.sh
To run delUsers go into the data_files/goodUsers.txt file and put the names of authorized users in in this format: \n user1 \n user2 \n user3 \n etc...

(\n means new line. I added it because the way GitHub displays .md files is dumb. Just put the users line by line.)
